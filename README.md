# Smart Home Energy Management Project

## Overview

This project aims to design and implement a Smart Home Energy Management system using machine learning and IoT technologies. The goal is to optimize energy usage in a home environment based on historical data and user behavior. The project involves various steps, including dataset selection, IoT system design, data preprocessing, machine learning model implementation, user interface development, and integration with Tableau for visualization.

## Steps

### 1. Dataset Selection

The dataset selected for this project is the "HomeA-meter2" dataset, which contains energy consumption data for different devices in a home. The dataset includes information on devices such as lights, HVAC systems, and appliances.

### 2. IoT System Design

Design a theoretical IoT system that collects real-time energy consumption data from smart home devices, similar to the ones listed in the dataset. Define how the data will be transmitted, stored, and processed in the system.

### 3. Data Preprocessing

Clean and preprocess the selected dataset to ensure it includes relevant features such as time of day, day of the week, and historical energy usage patterns. Adjust the data to meet the project's specific requirements.

### 4. Machine Learning Model

Implement a machine learning model, such as regression or clustering, to predict energy consumption patterns. The model should recommend optimal usage schedules for different devices based on the provided features in the dataset.

### 5. User Interface Development

Create a user-friendly interface or mobile app that allows users to input preferences and view energy usage recommendations generated by the machine learning model. Consider incorporating features from the dataset, such as different appliance readings, to enhance the user experience.

### 6. Integration with Tableau

Visualize energy consumption trends and recommendations on a Tableau Public dashboard. The dashboard should display historical usage, predicted patterns, and user-friendly insights, utilizing the features from the dataset.

## Datasets

The project utilizes the "HomeA-meter2" dataset, sourced from the UMass Trace repository. The dataset provides detailed energy consumption data for various devices in a smart home.
